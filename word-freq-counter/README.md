- Red-Black Tree
- Chained Hash Table
- Open Addressing Hash Table

## 📄 Features

- Reads and cleans `.txt` files
- Ignores punctuation and case
- Supports compound words with hyphens
- Counts word frequencies
- Measures performance (comparisons, time, and a custom metric)
- Outputs results to text files

## 🛠️ Build Instructions

```bash
make
